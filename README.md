# 🔥 Mastering Closures in JavaScript

🚀 **Understanding Lexical Scoping & Closures** 🚀

## 🔹 What is Lexical Scoping?
Lexical scoping means a function’s **scope** (the variables it can access) is determined by **where it is written in the code**, not where it is called. 

This allows inner functions to access variables from their **parent scope**, but not vice versa.

## 🔹 What is a Closure?
A **closure** is when an inner function **remembers** variables from its **parent function's scope**, even after the parent function has finished executing.

### 💡 Example of a Closure:
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I'm from outerFunction!";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses outerVariable
    }

    return innerFunction; // Returns the inner function
}

const closureExample = outerFunction(); // outerFunction runs and returns innerFunction
closureExample(); // Still remembers outerVariable!
```

### 🔹 How Closures Work:
1️⃣ `outerFunction()` executes and creates `outerVariable`.
2️⃣ It **returns** `innerFunction` instead of calling it.
3️⃣ Even though `outerFunction` **finishes execution**, `innerFunction` still has access to `outerVariable`.
4️⃣ Calling `closureExample()` logs `outerVariable`, proving the closure works!

## 🔹 Why Should You Care About Closures?
✅ **Data Privacy (Encapsulation)** – Create private variables that can’t be accessed directly.
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return function () {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
```

✅ **Function Factories** – Generate functions dynamically.
```javascript
function multiplyBy(num) {
    return function (x) {
        return x * num; // num is remembered
    };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(double(10)); // 20
```

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
Closures are one of JavaScript’s **most powerful** features. They help with:
🔹 **Encapsulation** (hiding variables)
🔹 **State Management** (remembering values)
🔹 **Higher-Order Functions** (function factories)

Mastering closures will take your JavaScript skills **to the next level!**
