# Closure in JavaScript  

## **Lexical Scoping**  

### ðŸ“Œ What is Lexical Scoping?  
Lexical scoping means that a function's scope (the variables it can access) is determined by **where it is written in the code**, not where it is called.  

This allows inner functions to access variables from their **parent scope**, but not vice versa.
